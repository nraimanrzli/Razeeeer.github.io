He became the face of T1 (formerly SK Telecom T1), one of the most successful League of Legends teams in history. His exceptional skill, leadership, and consistency on the game’s biggest stages earned him immense popularity.

        Razer, a company known for its gaming peripherals, entered into a partnership with Faker to provide him with high-performance gaming gear.
